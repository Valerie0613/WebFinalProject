                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Marine Pollution:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Over 17 million metric tons of waste clogged the oceans in 2021, projected to double or triple by 2040.</li>
                                        <li>Plastic pollution is the most harmful, with 89% of plastic litter on the ocean floor coming from single-use items.</li>
                                        <li>Marine debris costs an estimated $13 billion annually in clean-up and economic losses.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <br>

                                <li><strong>Ocean Acidification:</strong> The oceanâ€™s pH has dropped by 30% since pre-industrial times, threatening marine ecosystems and food security.</li>
                                <br>

                                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Oceans absorb 23% of annual CO2 emissions and 90% of excess heat in the climate system, leading to marine heatwaves and coral reef destruction.</li>
                                <br>

                                <li><strong>Overfishing and Exploitation:</strong> Irresponsible fishing practices and tourism degrade ecosystems and strain marine resources.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Why It Matters?</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Oceans support nearly 1 million known species, provide 57 million jobs globally, and serve as the primary protein source for over 50% of people in least-developed countries.</li>
                                <li>Coastal ecosystems mitigate storm damage and support 80% of global tourism, generating $134 billion annually.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 style="color: rgb(23, 115, 252); text-decoration: underline;">Solutions</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>International Cooperation: Agreements like the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement (2023) aim to establish legal frameworks for protecting ocean habitats.</li>
                                <li>Local Actions: Reduce plastic use and ocean pollution. Make sustainable choices when purchasing seafood and marine-based products. Consume only what is necessary to limit waste.</li>
                                 <li>Policy and Conservation: Increase funding for ocean science and conservation. Implement effective, equitably managed protected areas to preserve biodiversity.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 style="color: rgb(23, 115, 252); text-decoration: underline;">What You Can Do ðŸ™Œ</h3> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Support local farmers and sustainable food practices.</li>
                                <li>Fight food waste.</li>
                                <li>Advocate for policies and businesses that promote food security.</li>
                                <li>Raise awareness in your community and on social media.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <strong>By addressing pollution, overfishing, and climate impacts, and by responsibly managing marine ecosystems, we can ensure their preservation for future generations.</strong>
