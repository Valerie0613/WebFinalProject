                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Dry Land Increase:</strong><br>
                                        Around 40% of Earth’s land is now dry, with significant impacts expected by 2100.</li><br>
                                    <li><strong>Drier Conditions: </strong><br>
                                        77.6% of Earth’s land became drier from 1990 to 2020.</li><br>
                                    <li><strong>Aridity Spread:</strong><br>
                                        Aridity now covers 40.6% of Earth’s land, up from 37.5% 30 years ago.</li><br>
                                    <li><strong>Permanent Change:</strong><br>
                                        Aridity is a permanent transformation, not just a temporary drought.</li><br>
                                    <li><strong>Affected Regions:</strong><br>
                                        Areas most impacted include southern Africa, Mediterranean countries, southern Australia, and parts of Asia and Latin America.</li><br>
                                    <li><strong>France’s Declaration:</strong><br>
                                        France officially declared itself affected by desertification for the first time, highlighting the global nature of the issue.</li><br>
                                    <li><strong>Global Warming Effects:</strong><br>
                                        Greenhouse gases contribute to the problem, altering rainfall and increasing evaporation.</li><br>
                                    <li><strong>Rising Vulnerability:</strong><br>
                                        2.3 billion people live in dry areas, and this number could rise to 5 billion due to climate change.</li>

                            Dry land now covers around <strong>40%</strong> 
                            of the Earth's land mass, excluding Antarctica, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) study found, cautioning the shift could affect up to
                            <strong>five billion people by 2100.</strong><br>
                            "Some 77.6 percent of Earth's land experienced drier conditions during the three decades leading up to 2020 compared to the previous 30-year period," the report said.
                            <br>It indicates an "existential threat" posed by the seemingly irreversible trends and showed that dry land - regions where agriculture is difficult -- increased by
                            <strong>4.3 million square kilometres </strong> between 1990 and 2020, an area a third the size of India. 
                            <br><br>
                            The warning comes during the 
                            <strong>Cop16 conference</strong> 
                            in Riyadh, aimed at responding to land degradation and drought amid ongoing climate change.
                            Additionally, 
                            <strong>aridity</strong>,
                            which refers to a chronic water shortage, now affects <strong>40.6%</strong> of Earth's land mass, up from <strong>37.5%</strong> 30 years ago.

                            The report highlights that regions most affected by aridity include countries bordering the
                            <strong>Mediterranean, southern Africa, southern Australia, and certain parts of Asia and Latin America.</strong>
                            Ibrahim Thiaw, the UNCCD Executive Secretary, emphasizes that this is the first time the
                            <strong>aridity crisis</strong>
                            has been documented with scientific clarity, describing it as an 
                            <strong>existential threat.</strong>
                            Unlike 
                            <strong>droughts</strong>
                            , which are temporary, 
                            <strong>aridity</strong>
                            represents a

                            <br><br>

                            The changes are largely attributed to 
                            <strong>global warming</strong>
                             caused by 
                            <strong>greenhouse gas emissions,</strong>
                            which alter rainfall patterns and increase evaporation. The report also points out that these drier climates are
                            <strong>irreversible</strong>
                             and are fundamentally reshaping life on Earth.

                            Jean-Luc Chotte, from the French Scientific Committee on Desertification, mentions that the report will help countries better anticipate and respond to desertification. It also stresses the need to 
                            <strong>adapt agricultural practices</strong> 
                            and find drought-resistant plant varieties as part of the long-term solution.

                            The report warns that as more land becomes arid, 
                            <strong>current solutions</strong>
                             may no longer be effective in the future.

                            has officially declared itself affected by

                            the Secretary of State for Francophone countries and International Partnerships, says France’s declaration at Cop16 sends a message of solidarity to vulnerable nations, challenging the idea that desertification is only an African issue.

                            <strong>water cuts</strong> 
                            are being enforced to cope with increasing consumption. Mainland France also faced an <strong>unprecedented drought in 2022, with a rainfall deficit of 25%</strong>
                            making it the second least rainy year since 1959. According to the French scientific committee on desertification, around
                            <strong>1% of France's territory</strong>is affected, particularly in the
                            <strong>Mediterranean rim, southern Corsica, and overseas territories such as Reunion Island, Guadeloupe, and Mayotte.</strong>

                            <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Forced migration to increase</h3>
                            "For the first time, a UN scientific body is warning that burning fossil fuels is causing permanent drying across much of the world," lead UNCCD Chief Scientist Barron Orr said.
                            <br><br>
                            He added this could have "potentially catastrophic impacts affecting access to water that could push people and nature even closer to disastrous tipping points".<br>
                            <br>Already, 2.3 billion people live in expanding dry areas, according to the report, with projections showing a "worst-case scenario" of five billion people living in the conditions as the planet continues to warm.
                            <br><br>
                            The effects of the chronic water shortages include soil degradation, ecosystem collapse, food insecurity and forced migration, according to the scientists.

                            To counter this trend, the scientists urged members to "integrate aridity metrics into existing drought monitoring systems", improve soil and water management, and "build resilience in vulnerable communities".
