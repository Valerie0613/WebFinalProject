                                    Recent models show that few female NARW survive past 50 years, with a median lifespan in the early 20s, significantly shorter than southern right whales.</li><br>

                                    The shortened lifespan is largely due to entanglements in fishing gear and vessel collisions.</li><br>

                                    Historically, NARW females started calving at 9-10 years with a calf every 3-4 years. Now, most begin calving in their mid-teens with an extended 7-year calving interval.</li><br>
