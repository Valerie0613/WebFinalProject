                                <li><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> On a global scale, women earn 23% less than men. Additionally, they dedicate three times as many hours to unpaid domestic and caregiving work, which significantly contributes to the gender pay gap and limits their opportunities in the workforce.</li><br>
                                <li><strong>Violence and Exploitation:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>35% of women aged 15-49 experience physical or sexual violence.</li>
                                        <li>1 in 3 girls in certain regions face female genital mutilation, leading to severe health risks.</li>
                                        <li>Nearly half of married women lack decision-making power over their sexual and reproductive health.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <ul>

                                        <li>47 years for equal representation in national parliaments.</li>
                                        <li>The COVID-19 pandemic worsened these inequalities, increasing care burdens on women and raising instances of violence.</li>
                                    </ul>
