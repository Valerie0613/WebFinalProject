                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services:</strong><br>
                                Forests and terrestrial ecosystems support over 80% of the planet's biodiversity, providing essential services like air and water purification, climate regulation, and soil fertility.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>Human Dependency and Climate Action:</strong><br>
                                Over 1.6 billion people rely directly on forests for their livelihoods. Protecting these ecosystems is crucial for combating climate change, preventing desertification, and ensuring sustainable land use for the well-being of all life on Earth.</li>

                            <strong>A thriving terrestrial ecosystem is fundamental to human survival. Protecting forests, halting biodiversity loss, and reversing land degradation are not just environmental causesâ€”they are essential for sustaining life, health, and economic stability on Earth. Sustainable practices and global cooperation are crucial to preserving these ecosystems for future generations.</strong>
